<h2 class="title">About me</h2>

**I was born and raised in Chappaqua, New York,** where I spent my childhood messing around on the computer, sometimes stopping to read, take photos, and play video games.

**I studied math and English literature Tufts University in Medford, MA.** After graduating, I soon settled in the Crown Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn, where I remain today.

**I am a data scientist at [Rent the Runway](https://www.renttherunway.com/).** In the past, I have worked as a fact-checker, breaking news reporter, research fellow at a museum of miniatures, EMT, and pizza delivery guy.

**My last name rhymes with [the hand sanitizer brand](https://forvo.com/word/purell/),** not the [round shape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle). (Not Steve Urkel but [*Stefan Urquelle*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sud1fak_65Q)).

**My contact information is on the [home page of this site](./).**

<h2 class="title">About this site</h2>

This website is built using [Hiccup](https://github.com/daturkel/hiccup), a homespun static site generator that I wrote to replace a [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) workflow I couldnâ€™t understand. Text is set in [Open Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans) and [Rubik](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Rubik). Peek behind the curtain on [GitHub](https://github.com/daturkel/danturkel.com).

The style sheet is made with [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) and [Bulma](https://bulma.io/). Image lightboxes are powered by [baguetteBox.js](https://github.com/feimosi/baguetteBox.js").
