            <p><strong>I was born and raised in Chappaqua, New York,</strong> where I spent my childhood messing around on the computer, sometimes stopping to read, take photos, and play video games.</p>
            <p><strong>I studied math and English literature Tufts University in Medford, MA.</strong> After graduating, I soon settled in the Crown Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn, where I remain today.</p>
            <p><strong>I am a data scientist at <a href="https://www.renttherunway.com/">Rent the Runway</a>.</strong> In the past, I have worked as a fact-checker, breaking news reporter, research fellow at a museum of miniatures, EMT, and pizza delivery guy.</p>
            <p><strong>My last name rhymes with <a href="https://forvo.com/word/purell/">the hand sanitizer brand</a>,</strong> not the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle">round shape</a>. (Not Steve Urkel but <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sud1fak_65Q">Stefan Urquelle</a></em>).</p>

            <p>Compilation, concatenation, minification, and general websitification are handled by a <del>complex</del> clever <a href="https://gulpjs.com/">Gulp</a> workflow. Peek behind the curtain on <a href="https://github.com/daturkel/danturkel.com">GitHub</a>.</p>
