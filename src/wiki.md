This page is where I collect some of the best Wikipedia articles I’ve come across. Newer entries are added to the top of the list.

<h5>

[Spectral evidence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_evidence)

</h5>

> Spectral evidence was testimony [during the Salem witch trials] that the accused witch’s spirit [...] appeared to the witness in a dream or vision (for example, a black cat or wolf). The dream or vision was admitted as evidence.


<h5>

[Selah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selah)

</h5>

A term that occurs over seventy times in the Old Testament but has no clear meaning.

> The significance of this term was apparently not known even by ancient Biblical commentators. This can be seen by the variety of renderings given to it.

<h5>

[System accident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_accident)

</h5>

> In 2012 Charles Perrow wrote, “A normal accident [system accident] is where everyone tries very hard to play safe, but unexpected interaction of two or more failures (because of interactive complexity), causes a cascade of failures (because of tight coupling).” Charles Perrow uses the term normal accident to emphasize that, given the current level of technology, such accidents are highly likely over a number of years or decades.

<h5>

[Restrictions on geographic data in China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restrictions_on_geographic_data_in_China)

</h5>

> Due to national security concerns, the use of geographic information in the People’s Republic of China is restricted to entities that obtain a special authorization [...]
> 
> [The Chinese geodesic datum GCJ-02] uses an obfuscation algorithm which adds apparently random offsets to both the latitude and longitude, with the alleged goal of improving national security.

<h5>

[Deviancy amplification spiral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deviancy_amplification_spiral)

</h5>

> A deviancy amplification spiral [...] is a media hype phenomenon defined by media critics as a cycle of increasing numbers of reports on a category of antisocial behaviour or some other ‘undesirable’ event, leading to a moral panic.

<h5>

[Andrew Lyne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Lyne)

</h5>

> In 1991, Andrew Lyne and Matthew Bailes reported that they had discovered a pulsar orbited by a planetary companion; this would have been the first planet detected around another star. However, after this was announced, the group [...] found that they had not properly removed the effects of the Earth’s motion around the Sun from their analysis, and, when the calculations were redone correctly, the pulse variations that led to their conclusions disappeared[.] When Lyne announced the retraction of his results at a meeting of the American Astronomical Society, he received a standing ovation from his scientific colleagues for having the intellectual integrity and the courage to admit this error publicly.
> 
> No retraction was necessary in 2003, when Lyne and his team discovered the first binary system found in which both components were pulsed neutron stars. Lyne’s colleague Richard Manchester called the PSR J0737-3039 system a “fantastic natural laboratory” for studying specialized effects of the General Theory of Relativity.

Quoted from an [earlier revision](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Andrew_Lyne&oldid=736037511) of the article.
