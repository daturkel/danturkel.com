I’m a data scientist at [Rent the Runway](https://www.renttherunway.com/), an occasional amateur photographer and writer, and a ginger ale enthusiast.

You can get in touch with me by [email](mailto:daturkel@gmail.com) and on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dan-turkel-773b7249/). I’m also occasionally found on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/daturkel) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/daturkel/), and always on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/1286929325).
