# danturkel.com

This repo contains the source for my personal website, [danturkel.com](https://danturkel.com).

Included in the repo is code from [feimosi](https://github.com/feimosi)'s lovely [baguetteBox.js](https://github.com/feimosi/baguetteBox.js/) lightbox script.

The site also uses the [Bulma](https://github.com/jgthms/bulma) CSS framework and is built with [Gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp).

Excluded from this repo are jpg images used to populate photo galleries, as well as the `node_modules` directory.
